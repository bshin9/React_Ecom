# REACT-ECOMMERCE APP

This is my Ecommerce App on Proper Watch. I wanted to create a website that mirros off of Conor McGregor's Proper Whiskey business. Throughout the website, you will see classical watches that range from a wide variety of style as well as price range. I wanted to pay homage to McGregor's homeland, Ireland. The website is full of Irish pride and represents their colors in a sleek design.

## REACT

## NODE JS
