# REACT-ECOMMERCE APP

This is my Ecommerce App on Proper Watch. I wanted to create a website that mirros off of Conor McGregor's Proper Whiskey business. Throughout the website, you will see classical watches that range from a wide variety of style as well as price range. I wanted to pay homage to McGregor's homeland, Ireland. The website is full of Irish pride and represents their colors in a sleek design. 

## REACT

This project is done in React and the front end is entirely based off of React components. We used this because we replaced our full static e-commerce page and converted it into React. This allowed us to sync our backend databases with our frontend which means that we no longer needed to use JS for the filtering of products.

## NODE JS

The back end of the project was done using Node JS, mySql, and then linking these together to the frontend. This was utilized heavily throughout this project and it allowed for us to easily post our product data along with our customer data to the frontend. 

## USAGE

```bash
start by using `npm install` inside the folder, this will create the node modules you need to run the app
then run the app by `npm start`
the app should start running and you should be good to go
```
